## Introduction

ArcFace embeddings are a technique used for face recognition tasks that learn discriminative features to enhance the separation between classes. This repository provides an implementation of 2D ArcFace embeddings and includes code for training the model and visualizing the embeddings' separation.

## Installation

To use this code, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/jayeshmahapatra/ArcFace-Embedding-Visualization.git
```
2. Install the required dependencies.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Set up the dataset (see [Dataset](#dataset) section for more details).

## Usage

To use this code, perform the following steps:

1. Prepare the dataset (see [Dataset](#dataset) section for more details).
2. Configure the hyperparameters and settings in the appropriate files.
3. Train the model by running the training script:
   ```
   python train.py
   ```
4. Visualize the embeddings using the provided visualization script:
   ```
   python visualize.py
   ```
5. Analyze the results and evaluate the separation of classes (see [Results](#results) section).

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation is the CelebA dataset, which contains a large number of celebrity face images. Before using the dataset, it needs to be preprocessed and labeled properly. Follow these steps:

1. Download the CelebA dataset from [link to dataset](insert-link-here).
2. Extract the dataset and place it in the appropriate directory (e.g., `data/img_align_celeba`).
3. Generate the annotations file (`data/identity_CelebA.txt`) containing the identities and labels for each image.

## Model

The model used for this project is based on the ArcFace approach for face recognition. It utilizes a neural network architecture that learns discriminative features to enhance the separation between different classes. The model's implementation can be found in the `models.py` file.

## Training

The training process is performed using the ArcFace loss function and the Adam optimizer. The training script (`train.py`) handles the training procedure and saves the best model based on validation loss. Hyperparameters and settings can be adjusted in the script.

## Visualization

The visualization script (`visualize.py`) generates visualizations of the embeddings to show the separation between different classes during the training process. The embeddings are visualized in a 2D space, allowing the observation of class separation over epochs.

## Results

The results of the training process can be analyzed by examining the visualizations of the embeddings. By observing how different classes are separated from each other in the 2D space, it is possible to evaluate the effectiveness of the ArcFace embeddings in enhancing class discrimination.
